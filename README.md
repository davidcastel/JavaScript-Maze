# JavaScript-Maze :snake: 

### About :blue_book: :
This is a project inspired by a previous project that I created for a University Class. (You can check out the inspiration of this project [here](https://github.com/davidcastel/Python-Maze)).

I decided to re-write my old project that was based on Python using JavaScript and learn more about classes and the fundamentals of JavaScript.
